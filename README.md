# Statista Case Study

Submission for the 
[Statista Case Study](docs/Case_Study_-_Software.pdf).

## Analysis

Statista is a large provider of data looking to create an API to expose to RAG-like (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. Below is a workflow diagram of a simple RAG application. The provider application is any application that wishes to use Statista data to augment its LLM.

The Statista API will sit at the data retrieval layer of the RAG. It will return relevant documents that can be used to power an LLM allowing it to produce better, more relevant results.

### Document Stores

A crucial part of the Statista APIâ€™s usefulness will be its ability to return relevant results from a large database of over 1 million statistics and 80,000 topics. Depending on the nature of the data different database types can be used. Although the sample data for this case study has a well defined schema that could be used in a relational databse, this demo will implement the search on a vector database. A vector database was chosen because Statista has a large amount of data across many topics that may be unstructured. It is also possible for an endpoint to query multiple database if the need arises.


## Code

A small demo has been created to illustrate how an API can query a vector store to retrieve documents for RAG applications. Key features of the demo code are:

* Written in Python 3.13
* Faker to create mock data
* FastAPI for the REST API
* ChromaDB for the Vector Store

### Instructions

1. Install

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Create the mock data (Optional)

    ```bash
    python mock_data.py
    ```

    The mock data will be cached locally in the `mock_data.json` file. Delete this file if you ever want to regenerate the mock data. This step is optional. If the mock data doesn't exist, it will be created automatically in the next step when populating the Chroma store.

1. Populate the Chroma vector store with the mock_data

    ```bash
    python vector_store.py
    ```

    This step will load the mock data into a Chroma database and persist it to the folder `mock_data_chroma.db`. Subsequent runs will load from this persisted store. To recreate the database from the mock data, delete the persisted folder and rerun this command.

1. Run

    ```bash
    fastapi dev main.py
    ```

1. Visit the api docs page and use the swagger UI to test endpoint.

    You can explore available endpoints and the expecte payload schema. To interact with the endpoint click the "Try it out" button at the top right of each endpoint. This will allow you to submit to the endpoint and see the results.
